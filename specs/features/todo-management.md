# Feature: Basic Task CRUD (Phase I)

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to **Add** a task with a title and description so I don't forget it.
2. As a user, I want to **View** all my tasks to see what is pending.
3. As a user, I want to **Update** a task if details change.
4. As a user, I want to **Delete** a task I no longer need.
5. As a user, I want to **Mark as Complete** to track progress.

## Data Structure (In-Memory)
- Use a Python List of Dictionaries.
- Task ID should be an auto-incrementing Integer.
