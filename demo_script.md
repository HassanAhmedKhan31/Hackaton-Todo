## 60-Second Elevator Pitch

**(Start with a confident and energetic tone)**

"Are you tired of Todo apps that are just simple checklists? We've built an intelligent task manager that not only keeps you organized but also does the work for you.

Our app was initially slow, with AI processing taking up to three minutes, leaving users waiting. We solved this by re-architecting our system for speed. Now, our UI updates in under a second.

How did we do it? We use an event-driven architecture with microservices. For local development, we orchestrate our containers with Kubernetes. For production, we're live on Vercel, which allows us to scale on demand. When you type in a task like 'plan a team offsite,' our AI agent gets to work in the background, turning your words into a structured, actionable plan.

This isn't just another Todo app. It's a smart assistant that's fast, scalable, and ready to help you be more productive. Thank you."
