### Project Description

This project is a modern, event-driven Todo application designed for performance and scalability. The backend is built with FastAPI, a high-performance Python web framework, which allows for rapid development and asynchronous request handling. To ensure a responsive user experience, long-running operations, such as processing tasks with an AI agent, are delegated to background tasks using FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks`. This approach allows the API to immediately return a response to the client, while the AI processing happens asynchronously, preventing blocking and ensuring the "Add" button is always fast.

For scalability and resilience, the application is containerized and deployed on a Kubernetes cluster, managed locally with Minikube. This setup allows for easy scaling of individual services and provides a robust environment for running the application. The use of Kubernetes ensures that the application can handle a growing number of users and tasks, and provides a clear path for production deployment. The declarative nature of Kubernetes manifests makes the deployment process repeatable and reliable.

The application leverages an AI agent powered by OpenRouter to provide intelligent task processing. When a user adds a task, the AI agent analyzes the task's title and content to automatically add relevant details, such as a generated description. This "smart" processing is handled by the aforementioned background tasks, ensuring that even time-consuming AI operations do not impact the user's experience. The AI agent's capabilities can be extended to include features like task categorization, priority setting, and deadline suggestions, making the application a truly intelligent assistant.
