## My Journey: From Graphic Designer to AI Developer

As a graphic designer, my world has always been about creativity, user experience, and visual storytelling. I've spent years obsessing over pixels, layouts, and how to create intuitive, beautiful interfaces. But I always felt there was a gap between my vision and the final product—a gap I wanted to bridge myself.

This hackathon has been an incredible journey of bridging that gap. I've gone from designing mockups in Figma to building a full-stack, AI-powered application. I've wrestled with backend logic in Python, orchestrated microservices with Kubernetes, and deployed a scalable application to the cloud.

The most exciting part has been seeing how my skills as a designer can merge with the power of AI. I'm not just building a functional application; I'm designing an intelligent experience. This project has taught me that the future of technology is not just about code; it's about creating a seamless fusion of design, data, and intelligence.

I started this journey as a graphic designer who was curious about code. I'm ending it as a developer who is passionate about building the next generation of AI-driven products. This is just the beginning.
